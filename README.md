## LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION USING IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON DATASET

This project aims to use machine learning models to determine the likelihood of
loan default, in todayâ€™s corporate world, lending and borrowing money from financial
institutions creates new chances for financial institutions; most banks and credit unions
rely heavily on loan interest and associated fees for revenue, yet, there is a risk of
suffering losses due to loan defaulters. Lending money to individuals has become a
common business activity for financial organisations. Every day, people seek money
from various financial institutions for a variety of reasons. In contrast, not every
individual in need of a loan is trustworthy, and not all persons are eligible for loans.
Furthermore, a significant proportion of people fail to repay the amount provided by
lending institutions on a yearly basis, causing these organisations to incur significant
losses
